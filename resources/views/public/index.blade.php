                        Ever wanted to have your own products at your own salon to offer to your clients? 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                       At Dream Beauty Brands we can turn this dream into a reality with just a few clicks of the mouse. 
                       You can now have your very own products presented on your shelves and its so easy! Whether
                       you want to use one of our many templates or prefer to design your products from scratch, Dream Beauty 
                       Brands has the solutions to get your products out there for your customers to see.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       There are millions of different packaging design options out there. However, in the hair industry, we 
                       find that brands are not terribly creative with the bottles. The only visual difference between products 
                       is their labelling and branding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       You can change this. You can differentiate yourself from the competition and increase your own brand recognition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       You can be as involved as you like with the creation of your products. We have perfected formulations ready to go, 
                       which will be packaged under your brand/salon name and can be on your shelves in as little as two weeks. We have 
                       made the process super simple to get started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you get started and see the great response, you can look at creating your own fragrance for the products. If 
                        you are feeling super creative, meet with us and create your own formulations from beginning to end!

                        Like yourself, we work in the hair and beauty industry. We have worked with all the big names and we have seen a 
                        substantial amount of change in the way the industry functions over recent years. There is little respect given 
                        to professional products anymore and I’m sure you’ll agree, times are tougher now than they have ever been. We 
                        have to contend with online prices, no restrictions on professional-only products and now there is little business 
                        left for the hair salons. The product ranges have become so big and mass market that they are almost unaffordable 
                        to stock and the salon support just isn’t there anymore.

                        <strong>Dream Beauty Brands is dedicated to bringing back power to the salons.</strong> By offering your own brand 
                        you can cut out some of the big name brands who offer professional products that still end up selling in retail chains, 
                        which undercuts your price and your credibility. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With our private label solutions, salon owners will have the opportunity to connect further with clients while simultaneously 
                        building a brand that will assist in growing overall business. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sounds good? We think so; let us help you turn your private label dreams into reality.

                        <strong>Why not?</strong> You’re already supplying products through your salon. Your own branded products are 
                        likely to increase sales and increase revenue. Why promote other people’s brands, when you can promote your own?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>You have a name that your clients trust.</strong> Everyone trusts their hairdresser, and this strong connection 
                        to their stylist will foster a receptivity to the salon’s products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>You will gain a higher client retention.</strong> If your client knows you have the best product for their hair, 
                        they simply will have to come back to you to buy it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>No internet competition!</strong> Its hard when you are trying to sell products to your clients who trust you, 
                        only to discover that the products that you sold them are now available online, after telling them that they were exclusively 
                        for sale in salons. This is a breach of your trust, and since most of us treat clients like friends, is a hard thing to do and 
                        can result in less salon sales.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Endless sale or promotional opportunities.</strong> You’re in control, you know your clients and the way your salon 
                        works the best , so you can create your offers directly for your customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>No restrictions on resale.</strong> This is your brand name and you can sell your products wherever and however you like. 
                        If you chose to promote your products online or just on social media, this is entirely your choice.

                                        Our design team can completely design the packaging utilizing your logo and your input 
                                        regarding your brand identity. We will present you with the finished project.

                                        Or, you can have the logo designed yourself and just provide us with the finished artwork for 
                                        print. This is part of the initial set-up only and we will keep the artwork safe for your repeat orders.
