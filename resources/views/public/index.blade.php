                        one of our many templates or prefer to design your products from scratch, Dream Beauty Brands has

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are millions of different packaging design options out there. However, in the hair industry
                        brands are not too creative with the bottles - just their labelling and branding really
                        differentiates them. You can be as involved as you like with the creation of your products. We have
                        perfected formulations ready to go, which will be packaged under your brand/salon name and can be
                        on your shelves in as little as two weeks. We have made the process super simple to get started.
                        Once you get start and see the great response, you can look at creating your own fragrance for the
                        products. If you are feeling super creative, meet with us and create your own formulations from
                        beginning to end!

                        Like yourself, we work in the hair and beauty industry. We have worked with all the big names and
                        we have seen a substantial amount of change in the way the industry works over recent years. There
                        is little respect given to professional products anymore and I’m sure you’ll agree, times are tougher
                        now than they have ever been. We have to contend with online prices, no restrictions on professional
                        only products and now there is little business left for the hair salons. The product ranges have
                        become so big and mass market that they are almost unaffordable to stock and the salon support just
                        isn’t there anymore.

                        Dream Beauty Brands is dedicated to bring back power to the salons. By offering your own brand you
                        can cut out some of the big name brands who offer professional products that still end up selling
                        in retail chains.  With our private label solutions salon owners will have opportunity to connect
                        further with clients while simultaneously building a brand that will assist in growing overall
                        business. Sounds good? We think so, let us help you turn your private label dreams into reality.

                        your trust, and since most of us treat clients like friends, is a hard thing to do resulting
                        in less salon sales.
