                        Like yourself, we work in the hair and beauty industry. We have worked with all the big 
                        names and we have seen a substantial amount of change in the way the industry works, 
                        particularly recently. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is little respect given to professional products anymore; in fact, we think times are
                        tougher now than they have ever been. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have to contend with online prices, products with no restrictions on professional-only 
                        sale (despite promises by distributors). All of these cut into product sales, which have 
                        always been and need to continue to be a significant revenue source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The product ranges have become so big they are almost unaffordable to stock and the salon
                        support just isn’t there as much now. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then there’s Juan….
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately we had the opportunity to meet Juan, who owns a laboratory in the USA, one of 
                        the most knowledgeable and helpful people we have ever encountered. He truly is an industry 
                        expert in the chemistry of hair care. More importantly, he shares our values: that products 
                        be made with ethics and with the highest quality formulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together we have created professional products, made without any compromise on ingredients 
                        and formulated to create absolutely professional results. Together with Juan, we created the 
                        concept of offering these products directly to salons, under each salon’s  own brand. These 
                        will be products the stylists can trust and confidently recommend to their clients. You, as a 
                        small business owner now possess  same ability to create formulas that the big brands have, 
                        with better product and more control in every way.

                        <strong>Amazing formulations.</strong> We spend timeless hours in the lab working with some of the 
                        best chemists in the industry to create unrivaled formulations that do not have any budget 
                        restraints. We take immense pride in our true cutting-edge formulas, comprised of family produced 
                        products, created the old fashioned way.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Ethics.</strong> We create all our own products in guidance with professionals from all 
                        around the world. We do not copy other people’s formulations. We source all our products carefully 
                        and locally to ensure they comply with all the regulatory guidelines. We ensure every ingredient 
                        used, even the raw ingredients, are not tested on animals and come from from suppliers that share 
                        our environmental ethics.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Honesty.</strong> We will always tell you the truth. You will know what ingredients are 
                        used and why we have used them. We want you to have the confidence to recommend a product, not 
                        from a sales pitch, but from trust.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Finest Ingredients.</strong> We want to get results, not fit into a price bracket. We do
                        not compromise on the quality of our ingredients, nor do we use cheap substitutes for different 
                        raw ingredients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Healthy Hair.</strong> Every product we make has been created with the underlying goal of 
                        creating healthy hair. This is easier when you’re thinking shampoo, conditioner etc, but even our
                        styling products with hold have conditioning properties added!

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Organic.</strong> We believe in using organic ingredients wherever possible, so we use 
                        many USDS certified organic ingredients. These are the highest standard of certification for organic.
